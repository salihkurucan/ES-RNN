# Fast ES-RNN: A GPU Implementation of the ES-RNN Algorithm

## I have used the ES-RNN repository to forecast energy consumption. Many thanks to the makers of this repository!

A GPU-enabled version of the [hybrid ES-RNN model](https://eng.uber.com/m4-forecasting-competition/) by Slawek et al that won the M4 time-series forecasting competition by a large margin. The details of our implementation and the results are discussed in detail on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03329)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
Python (3.5+)
Tensorflow (1.12+ to 1.14)
PyTorch (0.4.1)
Zalando Research's Dilated RNN
```

### Dataset

Please download the M4 competition dataset directly from [here](https://github.com/M4Competition/M4-methods/tree/master/Dataset) and put the files in the data directory.

### Running the algorithm

Either use an IDE such as PyCharm or make sure to add the es\_rnn folder to your PYTHON PATH before running the [main.py](es_rnn/main.py) in the es\_rnn folder. You can change the configurations of the algorithm in the [config.py](es_rnn/config.py) file.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org) - The *data science* language ;)
* [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/) - The dynamic framework for computation
